# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, mostly for personal use but you may find some inspiration here.

Many are out of date, almost all need better documentation.

## Installation

To install all files quickly on a new machine, `stow` can be used.

`stow` is available via homebrew and most other package managers.

```
mkdir ~/stow
cd ~/stow
git clone git@github.com:aaronjameslang/dotfiles.git
stow dotfiles
```
